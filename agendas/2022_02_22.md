## Last Week

- Firebase was and configured to track user's saved recipes
- Local recipe data data store was switched over to redux
- Recipes now get saved to firebase and load when the user opens the app
- Recipes get suggested and can be saved to the user's list of recipes
- Work began on the shopping screen to start suggesting items for the user to shop for
- Authentication was fixed and implemented
- Pantry screen has categories
- Pantry screen received better test data

## This Week

- Shopping screen will start suggesting items based on expiration date
- Recipe Add screen is getting updated to ask for the user the ingredient details when adding a recipe
- Work will finish on the view and edit recipe screens
- Redux data will persist to the storage on the phone to persist across app reloads
