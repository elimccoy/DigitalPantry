# Agenda Jan 18th, 2022

## Last Week

- We chose to use react-native for development of our app.
    - Eli created the repo on github and began the boilerplate.
    - Our members less familiar with react-native familiarized themselves with the technology.
- We made our own vision of the design and met on Wednesday to combine them on Figma
    - You can view our design [here](https://i.imgur.com/0HtvaY2.png)
- On friday, we met for an hour to create the issue backog
    - We decided to use github for issue tracking, you can view them [here](https://github.com/elimccoy/DigitalPantry/issues)
    - We assigned issues

## This Week

- We are beginning development and working on the issues.

## Blockers

- We found [BarcodeSpider](https://www.barcodespider.com/).
    - Caleb will begin trying it out this week and implementing it.
    - It's affordable and the free plan provides us with plenty of lookups for development if we each create a separate account for development however we are curious if the school would be able to provide us with $20-$30 for a few months of the free plan which provides us with 10x the lookups.
    - You can view the prices [here](https://devapi.barcodespider.com/)
